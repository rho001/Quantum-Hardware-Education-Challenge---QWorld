# Photonic quantum computing with Strawberry Fields


We are developing a four-day workshop material like QBronze and QSilver. This is supposed to be a continuation of both programs, so we are assuming basic knowledge of quantum computing. The focus of the workshop is to introduce quantum computing on photonic platform, mainly through Xanadu’s Strawberry Fields library. The outline are as follows:

Day 1
•	Introduction to quantum optics
•	Gates in photonic quantum computing

Day 2
•	Measurements
•	Time domain circuits

Day 3
•	Using Xanadu’s photonic hardware
•	GKP states and universal quantum computing

Day 4 (incomplete, lacking explanations)
•	Boson sampling
•	Quantum neural network

Each day is expected to last for 2 hours. There are two chapters per day, that means we have around 1 hour per chapter. All tutorials will be based on Jupyter Notebook. There will be exercises across the notebooks. At the end of each chapter, students will need to take a quiz.

Optional day 5 / take home / for fun – Projects

We are mainly inspired by the tutorials in the Strawberry Fields website. However, some of the concepts might be too daunting for a beginner. Hence, we provide a gentle version of the tutorials, in a more structured manner.


# Installing Strawberry Fields

Before the first day, the students can install Strawberry Fields by using pip.

In Jupyter Notebook, just type (in the cell):

pip install StrawberryFields

and then run the cell to install the package. You will require Python 3.7 and above.
